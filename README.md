# ETC 2

This repository contains the original source map files for my Half-Life mod [ETC 2](https://www.johnsto.co.uk/design/personal/#hl-etc2). Some maps use custom textures and/or sounds which are supplied with the ETC 2 release and can be downloaded [here](https://www.johnsto.co.uk/files/hl/djetc2.exe).

Notes:

* the code was built using the SDK 2.2 codebase
* lacking models/sprites/sounds? They're in the ETC2 release (download link is above)

Anyone is permitted to use these maps and textures in their own projects provided credit is given. A link to [my website](https://www.johnsto.co.uk) and/or this repository would be appreciated so others may see the original files.
