These are the source map files and source code for hl.dll for ETC 2. Some maps use custom textures, sounds and/or models which are supplied with the ETC 2 release.

Anyone is permitted to use these maps, textures and code in their own projects provided credit is given. A link to my website would be appreciated so others also have the opportunity to download these source files themselves.

If you do decide to work on the maps for any purpose, and run into trouble directly related to ETC2 (for example I'm not going to tell you how to use Hammer, but I can tell you why I chose to do something in ETC2 one way and not another), do contact me. I'll try my best to help.

Notes:
- the .dll was built using the SDK 2.2 codebase (most likely has changed since then)
- lacking models/sprites/sounds? They're in the ETC2 release.
